    <b>Can/Should i trust this addon?</b> You can view the source code by either
    visiting the Homepage/Support Site or just saving/downloading the XPI (which
    is really just a ZIP Archive) and then extract it locally. The Sources in
    the XPI should be unofuscated and unminified (HTML,CSS and JS), so it's as
    easy to read as possible. Alternatives you can also use the
    <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/crxviewer/"
      >CRX Viewer Extension by Rob W</a
    >
    to inspect the XPI sources. If you have an questions, you can also open an
    issue on the support site and i'll try and answer to the best of my
    abilities. If you are no programmer and are still feeling unsure, you might
    want to visit one of the official or unoffical mozilla communities and ask
    if someone there with more knowlege can take a look. Examples:
    https://reddit.com/r/firefox , https://lemmy.world/c/firefox or
    https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#addons:mozilla.org
